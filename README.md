####An Interactive Map of International Refugee Flows
[See Outflux live on Heroku](http://outflux.herokuapp.com/)

Outflux was designed to help users visualize ongoing global refugee crises and access specific country information from the UN Refugee Agency's news feed.

The Outflux map pulls in information from UNHCR's Historical Population Database on refugees from 10 countries around the world from 2000-2012. To view, click on a country of origin and drag the year slider to see the total number of refugees for a given year and where they relocated to.

For countries declared current emergencies, the app will scrape all recent news stories from UNCHR's feed and display them in the "In the News" tab.
