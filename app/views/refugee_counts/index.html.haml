This map was created with historical <a href='http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a013eb06.html' target='_blank'>data</a> from the <a href='http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home' target='_blank'>UN Refugee Agency</a> and was designed to help users visualize ongoing global refugee crises and bring this data to life through news coverage and individual stories."
